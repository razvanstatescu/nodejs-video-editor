# Video editor using NodeJS 

This repository is associated with [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/4hJLIMp51Cg).

In [this](https://youtu.be/4hJLIMp51Cg) video we made a video editor from scratch using NodeJS. We useed ffmpeg and jimp to help us with the editing (link for those in the video description). I recently started an [Instagram account](http://instagram.com/the.dev.guy/) so I wanted to make a quick video editor that will add some padding to the video to match the aspect ratio for IGTV and a watermark.
